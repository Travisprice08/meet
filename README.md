![meet](/Meet.png)

## Description

Meet App is a serverless, progressive web application that uses the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar) to fetch upcoming events. The app is built with React using a test-driven development (TDD) approach. The serverless function is hosted by AWS.

The app alows user to search for a city and get a list of events hosted in that city. The user can view charts that display how many events will take place in that city on upcoming days as well as view the popularity of event genres in the form of a pie chart.

## Quick Start üöÄ

Scenario 1: When using application while offline
Given there is no internet connection available
 	When the user wants to view information to events last viewed
	Then the user should be able to see information from data in the cache
Scenario 2: The user attempts to create new search criteria
Given that there is no internet connection available
